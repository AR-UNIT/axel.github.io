AXEL - A New Dimension of Start-up Mentorship

AXEL is mainly focused on the development of an online platform for mentoring startups. 

One of the main reasons for the failure of start-ups is the lack of experience and competency of new entrepreneurs. This is where mentorship of start-ups becomes important. It also connects the like-minded people and those with similar start-up ideas with profile and contact details. This is meant for Start-ups, individuals or workgroups who seek growth potential for their company.  What makes this web application unique is that it allows them to grasp creativity and innovation from various people whose experiences are worth a billion. 

Our idea proposes to find the experts in various domains who are interested to share their experiences and views with the budding start-ups. This is prevented by prospective investments and sponsorships which are promoted by our idea. The talented college students and other people who have ideas, but donâ€™t intend to become an entrepreneur are motivated to start their own company.
As expected from any start-up mentoring platform, the proposed solution provides search facilities to find popular start up ideas, mentors in either their locality or domain. Even the mentors who are not completely associated with the start-ups can help in guiding the start-ups by answering questions and voting in polls.  Potential start-up ideas can be nipped in the bud by lack of proper funding.
